quarfs
======

quarfs is a prototype of mixed voxel engine with advanced graphics (as advanced as I can get them to be)

it uses:

- GLEW 
- GLFW3
- BOOST (filesystem )

Requires OpenGL 4 compatibility, (not very sure about this, but there are some host code functions which are pretty new and some other thins in the shaders)

It also require some C++11 support by your favourite compiler.
