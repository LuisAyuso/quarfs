NAVIGATION:
===========

    - add navigation: joystick and/or mouse
    - think on interaction

RENDER:
=======

    - what hapens with the normals? 
        - can we draw them?
        - how we incorporate better lighting
    - 20k cubes: 10fps how can we solve this?
        - compute single surface, draw everything at once
        - clip planes, trim the map-tree also


    - two pass render, create a static map to enable interaction (hidden buffer)
    - projected shadows, much nicer 3d sensation (also moving sun... pretty cool)

MAP:
====

    - octree algorithm
    - add more sofisticated map generation, 2 perlin passes + generative erosion
    - map generation is a problem, research something nice
