NAVIGATION:
===========

    - add navigation: joystick and/or mouse
    - think on interaction

RENDER:
=======

    - move all the gl instructions into vbos (map cubes into cordinates)
    - projected shadows, much nicer 3d sensation (also moving sun... pretty cool)
    - two pass render, create a static map to enable interaction (hidden buffer)
    - nice shader vs textures? 

MAP:
====

    - octree algorithm
    - add more sofisticated map generation, 2 perlin passes + generative erosion

    - map generation is a problem, research something nice
