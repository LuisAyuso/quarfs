NAVIGATION:
===========

    - add navigation: joystick and/or mouse
    - think on interaction


RENDER:
=======

    -- add Zbuffer, it shems that whe draw by order

    - projected shadows
    - move all the gl instructions into vbos (map cubes into cordinates)
    - two pass render, create a static map to enable interaction (hidden buffer)
    - nice shader vs textures? 


MAP:
====

    -- fix the mesh with the tree
    - octree algorithm
    - add more sofisticated map generation, 2 perlin passes + generative erosion
